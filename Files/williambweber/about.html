    <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Willie. I am 36 years old, from Woodinville, married, and I have 4 kids (3 boys and 1 girl). I love sports and all the local teams! Go Huskies, Seahawks, Mariners, Sounders, and Sonics (May God bring them back to us). I am also a singer/songwriter. I have played bass guitar for 22 years and guitar for 16 years.</p>
    
    <p>I spent 6 years in various non-denominational missions with YWAM out of high school. I lived in Maui at the YWAM base when I was not out of the country on outreaches. I have been to Japan, China, Philippines, and Mexico. I enjoy traveling and meeting new people.</p>  
    
    <p>When I arrived back home to Woodinville. I started work in the transportation industry. I was an on-call driver when I began and over the last 11 years I worked my way up the ladder to a director postion. My position was eliminated in December and I am now on a new adventure going back to school. </p>
