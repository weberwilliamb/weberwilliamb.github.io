	<h2>Types of Litigation</h2>

	<h2>Corporate Profile:</h2>
	<p>All our attorneys have more than fifteen years experience. This experience 
	translates into efficiency in handling client problems. A majority of our work 
	is in litigation. Litigation may end in mediation, arbitration, or a trial, 
	but at all stages we handle litigation so that clients can decide what end is 
	best for them. Trial work is done by trial lawyers themselves, rather than layers 
	of associates and staff. Large national insurance companies and small businesses 
	have found our approach to legal problems affordable and efficient. </p>
