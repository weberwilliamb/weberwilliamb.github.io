        <dl>
              <dt>Question: After an auto accident, when do you a need to hire an attorney?</dt>
              <dd class="paddingshift">Answer: When the other driver is at fault, his or her insurance company is 
                ultimately paying the loss. Your own insurance company will handle your car 
                repairs and car rental if you have collision coverage and will handle the initial 
                medical bills if you have P.I.P. coverage. Some but rarely all of your wage 
                loss will be covered by your own P.I.P. coverage. If you do not have your own 
                collision coverage or P.I.P. coverage or when your own coverages are done paying, 
                then the other driver's insurance company handles your loss. Their loyalty is 
                to their own customer, not you. They owe you nothing unless you take their driver 
                to court and win. Sometimes the other insurance company will take over paying 
                your medical bills and your wage loss as an advance against the ultimate loss 
                they will have to pay on behalf of their driver. It is when they say no to paying 
                further wage loss or say no to paying further medical claims that you need your 
                own attorney. It is when they may offer to pay your non-economic damages such 
                as pain and suffering when you need to have your own attorney look at the value 
                of the case and evaluate whether the settlement they propose is in your best 
                interest.</dd>
                
              <dt>Question: What if I am in an auto accident with a driver who has no insurance?</dt>
              <dd class="paddingshift">Answer: Your under- insured motorist insurance (UIM) stands in the shoes of 
                the at fault driver. You are entitled to be paid your non-economic damages such 
                as pain and suffering through your own UIM coverage. This is an adversarial 
                relationship between you and your insurance company. When your own insurance 
                company makes an offer to pay your non-economic damages, you need to have your 
                own attorney look at the value of your U IM claim and evaluate whether the settlement 
                they propose is in your best interest.</dd>
                
              <dt>Question: how long do I have to decide whether to bring a lawsuit arising out 
                of an accident?</dt>
              <dd class="paddingshift">Answer: Washington state law gives you three years after an auto accident. 
                The same three-year statute of limitations applies to injuries arising out of 
                defective products or out of malpractice, but in some of these types of cases 
                you have three years from the time you discover you have a cause of action. 
                The statute of limitations for breach of a written contract is six years. A 
                claim against your own UIM insurance company is considered a claim on a written 
                contract.</dd>

		in handling client problems. A majority of our work is in litigation. Litigation 
		may end in mediation, arbitration, or a trial, but at all stages we handle litigation 
		so that clients can decide what end is best for them. Trial work is done by 
		trial lawyers themselves, rather than layers of associates and staff. Large 
		national insurance companies and small businesses have found our approach to 
		legal problems affordable and efficient.<p>
