        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>Ironbird Forge was established in 2003 after I quit my job; I was tired of doing the same old thing. When a contractor I knew asked me if I could build a railing for him I said sure, he said “the pickets need to look like arrows with a chipped obsidian arrowhead look” I said no problem. After the contractor was off the phone I turned to my son and described the look, I said “never done this before, how are we going to do it”? Well we figured it out and the contractor and his client were very pleased. That is the spirit of Ironbird Forge, give us a sketch on a napkin and we will give you a finished product that will meet all of your expectations. We use state of the art technology a 3D modeling program called SolidWorks, lasers to measure jobs, CNC plasma table and the like. We are also old school using a 1915 Little Giant power hammer to draw out and texture heated metal. We forge, drift holes and are well acquainted with an anvil and hammer. Ironbird Forge is looking towards the future and playing in the past. </p>
