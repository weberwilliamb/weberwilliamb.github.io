                <h3 class="collapse-h">Who is Willie Weber?</h3>
                <p class="p-text">I was born in Kirkland Washington in 1982. I have had an adventurous life so far and Web Development is my next adventure! </p>

                <p class="p-text">I have been in school for the last few years working hard. I have earned certifications for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, Photoshop, and many other skills. Before that I worked at a regional courier logistics company for 8 years as their Director of Dispatch Operations and Customer Relations for Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. In that position I learned how to not only manage many levels of teams throughout our locations, but also to listen and learn from my teams. I worked on Major rollout projects with Staples, Office Depot, and Microsoft for their delivery needs. This involved communicating from the lowest common denominator of the delivery locations to the conference calls with the regional/nation VPs. I became an expert in communicating within our company and to customers, which somedays were over 1k emails a day. </p>

                <p class="p-text">I am proud to be able to say that I have been able to see the world and learn about other cultures. In 2002 I was able to travel to China and participate in a government program for cultural exchange and to teach English. I also traveled to the Philippines in 2004 for 3 months with a Basketball team to different cities in Northern Luzon to teach English and hygiene to slum areas. Those trips taught me great respect for how diverse the world is. Being on teams much of my life has taught me that sometimes it is good to let others step up and to take the lead when necessary to help the team.</p>

                <p class="p-text">I have been honing my newly learned skills at Cascadia Community college in their web applications program for the last 2 years, earning a 3.9 GPA. I have worked on many team projects, including a project that delivered a UI redesign for a local forest non-profit website, an ASP.net Core MVC project for a Photo Point application, a Website for a metal work and design business in Montana. Thank you for coming by to take a look at my work!</p>
